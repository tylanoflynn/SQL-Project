# Final-Project-Transforming-and-Analyzing-Data-with-SQL

## Project/Goals
The goal of this project is to take a toy dataset with messy values and convert into a normalized relational database managed using PostgreSQL.

## Process
### First, I imported the data without modification\* into a PgSQL-managed database.
### Then, I cleaned and normalized the data while trying to minimize information loss, creating appropriate relationships between the tables.

## Results
(fill in what you discovered this data could tell you and how you used the data to answer those questions)

## Challenges 
- Opening all_sessions with libre office reallllly modified the fullvisitorids. In general, it was difficult to be non-destructive

## Future Goals
